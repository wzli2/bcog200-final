doesn't run as-is (some issues with button assignment I think). Changes need to be made:
1. Code the Stroop side of things
2. Fix the issue with running it
3. Save Data (how far the user went, maybe integrate response speed)
4. Make and save Plots (optional, don't really know what I'd even plot)
5. Edits to improve readability, conciseness
