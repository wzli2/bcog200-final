After running the program, a tkinter window pops up. The user is presented with 4 button options: standard, reverse, stroop, and reverse stroop. After selecting, the corresponding set of instructions pops up with a "next" button. After it's clicked, a sequence of stimuli pops up on the screen one after the other with a brief delay between each. Then text input is available, and the user recites the stimuli in the correct order with a space between each. The result is then assessed based on the correct sequence and the data is saved in a file.
