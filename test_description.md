After running the program, a tkinter window pops up. The user is presented with 4 button options: standard, reverse, stroop, and reverse stroop. After selecting, the corresponding set of instructions pops up with a "next" button. After it's clicked, a sequence of stimuli pops up on the screen, after which text input is available and the user recites the stimuli in the correct order. This continues until failure. The result is then assessed based on the correct sequence and the data is saved in a file.
